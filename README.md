# Generate-Random-directed-Tree
generate_multi_rooted_directed_tree(minimum_nodes, maximum_nodes, gap_in_size,no_of_roots); generate random trees and will be storing each file in working directory.
minimum_nodes: Data set of minimum size.
maximum_nodes :  Data set of Maximum size.
gap_in_size   : if you passed minimum_nodes= 10,  maximum_nodes = 20,  and gap_in_size = 5 means it creates treesof sizes : 10, 15, 20.
no_of_roots   : no. of roots you want: pass one for single rooted tree.
